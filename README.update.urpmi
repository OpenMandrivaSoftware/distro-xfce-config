Xfce doesn't update its configuration files into users home by itself.

Please remove these directories manually in your home, after update 
of mandriva-xfce-config and then restart your X session.

~/.config/xfce4
~/.config/Terminal
~/.config/Thunar

Do NOT to forget about doing backup of these directories.
